#Codetrotters Fellowship Coding Challenge Summer 2017


##About

**[Codetrotters Fellowship](http://www.codetrotters.com/fellowship)** 
links promising developers with global startups so they
can get invaluable real life experience.

As part of the application process we post a coding challenge every year, and this year's applications will be accepted through February 15th, 2017. 

You can read more about the Codetrotters *Fellowship* at [http://www.codetrotters.com/fellowship](http://www.codetrotters.com/fellowship)


##Participating in the Challenge

This is Round 2 of the Codetrotters Fellowship application.  **You must be invited to participate.**  Invitations will be sent based on performance in the first challenge, which can be found [here](https://github.com/codetrotters/codingchallenge2016).

To participate in this challenge, you need a *GitHub* account. Fork this repository and once you finish with your solution, *send* us a Pull Request.

We are looking forward to reading all your solutions!

##Challenge

Write a function that takes as an input an array of natural numbers and returns the greatest integer result of combining those natural numbers.

For example, the input `[ 50, 9, 17, 0]` should return the integer `950170`.

##Examples

```
[ 50, 9, 17, 0 ]            =>  950170
[ 342, 689 ]                =>  689342
[ 43, 5, 12, 99 ]           =>  9954312
[ 8, 4, 100 ]               =>  84100
[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]  =>  7654321
```
